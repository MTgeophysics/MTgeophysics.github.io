**Abstract**

The goal of this book is to provide executable examples of how to use open-source Python software packages written to deal with MT data, including [mt-metadata], [mth5], [aurora], [mtpy-v2], and [simpeg].

## Background

The initial work on open-souce software was focused on transfer functions (reading/writing, plotting, analysis, working with model input/outputs).  That work resulted in [mtpy], which was a general collection of scripts compiled into a repository with some object oriented code [Krieger \& Peacock, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.07.013).  The package was extended mainly by a group at Geoscience Australia into a more modern package including a testing framework and publishing to PyPi [Kirkby _et al._, 2019](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01358).  [mtpy] underwent went small updates but due to some unfortunate circumstances became unmaintainable and is now deprecated (**mtpy is deprecated. New version is mtpy-v2**).

Starting around 2020, a working group for metadata and data standards was created, led by IRIS, now Earthscope.  The goal of this group was to develop a standard set of metadata for MT data as well as a data standard.  Out of this came [mt-metadata], a metadata standard, and [mth5], a data format standard based on HDF5 ([Peacock _et al._, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2022.105102)).  Moreover, development of a processing code to estimate MT transfer functions was also supported which resulted in [aurora] a processing code based on Gary Egbert's EMTF code [Kappler _et al._, 2024](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06832).
